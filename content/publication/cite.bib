abstract = {Glass is increasingly desired as a material for manufacturing complex microscopic geometries, from the micro-optics in compact consumer products to microfluidic systems for chemical synthesis and biological analyses. As the size, geometric, surface roughness, and mechanical strength requirements of glass evolve, conventional processing methods are challenged. We introduce microscale computed axial lithography (micro-CAL) of fused silica components, by tomographically illuminating a photopolymer-silica nanocomposite that is then sintered. We fabricated three-dimensional microfluidics with internal diameters of 150 micrometers, free-form micro-optical elements with a surface roughness of 6 nanometers, and complex high-strength trusses and lattice structures with minimum feature sizes of 50 micrometers. As a high-speed, layer-free digital light manufacturing process, micro-CAL can process nanocomposites with high solids content and high geometric freedom, enabling new device structures and applications.},

@article{ChungLi2020,
abstract = {Computed axial lithography, when used in polymeric systems, directly solidifies freeform three-dimensional geometries inside liquid or gelled materials. Currently, this patterning system operates in open loop where projections are designed prior to the print so identification of errors and corrections can only be done after the printed object has been processed. This work introduces an in-situ 3D refractive index monitoring system to track localized material conversion by performing tomographic reconstruction from color Schlieren images. Our system successfully reconstructed evolving phase objects inside resins and the reconstruction quality was verified by comparison with isosurface laser scans. The technique provides support for physics-based real-time pattern modification to improve print fidelity and reduce manual iteration time when experimenting with new materials.},

abstract = {An E-1 payload, the Microgravity Materials Joining Investigative Chamber (MMaJIC), was designed and built for use aboard the International Space Station to investigate soldering and brazing phenomena in a microgravity environment. MMaJIC is a self-contained unit employing a microcontroller that runs a pre-programed experiment, monitors safety sensors, and supports temperature and video recording. MMaJIC uses individual experiment trays that can be easily modified for a specific investigation. The trays, which include a temperature/video data acquisition card, can be easily changed out and returned to Earth for evaluation. Simple operation of MMaJIC minimizes astronaut time while ensuring maximum sample throughput. It is expected that the results will shed considerable light on soldering and brazing in low-gravity environments, information that is important for NASA in conducting comprehensive repair and/or fabrication operations during long duration space missions.},

@article{Correa2016,
abstract = {Mesoscale electromechanical systems find applications in fields such as medical instrumentation, soft robotics, microscopy, flexible electronics and imagining. This paper implements the printed circuit MEMS (PC-MEMS) process [1] for the fabrication of a ‘pop-up' flexure-based mesoscale system that exploits the simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such as sheet-metal operations and laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism. The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or ‘pop-out') angles that the planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system. The simplicity of the processes makes it a candidate for the use in the emerging open-source hardware technologies for fabricating low-cost, complex, electromechanical systems.},
