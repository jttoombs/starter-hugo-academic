abstract: "Computed axial lithography (CAL) is an emerging volumetric additive manufacturing technology which presents unique opportunities in layerless ultra-rapid fabrication. However, the required process control places particular demands on computing and delivering the appropriate 3D distribution of optical energy, as well as monitoring the solidifying structure within the photo-resin. For example, continued reaction after tomographic exposure is not currently accounted for and could lead to higher degree-of-conversion than designed and consequent feature dilations. Color Schlieren Tomography (CST) is developed as an in-situ metrology tool to monitor volumetrically the internal refractive index and the forming geometry. Major improvements of CST in real-time computation and processing of 3D reconstruction have enabled event-driven patterning control such as auto-termination. With this technique, we monitored the polymerization process in real-time during and after termination of the exposure period signaled by an index-volume termination criterion. Monitoring of continued polymerization after termination (dark polymerization) shows that the refractive index change can rise to 10 times higher than its value at termination. The time-resolved 3D reconstruction data provided by CST can be used for chemical kinetics modeling and development of compensation schemes."
