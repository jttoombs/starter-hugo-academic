abstract: "Volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) enables rapid printing into a wide range of materials, offering significant advantages over other printing technologies, with a lack of inherent layering of particular note. However, VAM suffers fromstriations, similar in appearance to layers, and similarly limiting applications due to mechanical and refractive index inhomogeneity, surface roughness, etc. We hypothesize that these striations are caused by a self-written waveguide effect, driven by the gelation material nonlinearity upon which VAM relies, and that they are not a direct recording of non- uniform patterning beams. We demonstrate a simple and effective method of mitigating striations via a uniform optical exposure added to the end of any VAM printing process. We show this step to additionally shorten the period from initial gelation to print completion, mitigating the problem of partially gelled parts sinking before print completion, and expanding the range of resins printable in any VAM printer."
