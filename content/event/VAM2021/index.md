summary: 3D printing of silica glass with microscale tomographic VAM
abstract: 'Transparent glass nanocomposite materials consisting of silica glass nanoparticles and a liquid polymeric binder matrix have recently been utilized in a variety of advanced manufacturing techniques. We demonstrate volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) of glass components with micro computed axial lithography (CAL). We adapt the nanocomposite formulation to CAL with addition of photoinihibitor which induces a threshold polymerization response. We show production of multiaperture aspheric lenses which have high transparency, comparable to commercial fused silica, and low roughness. Complex lattice and truss structures are printed without support material, and they are free of layer defects which are inherent to other additive manufacturing techniques. The approach enables printing of positive features of 50 μm and pores of 215 μm. The VAM approach can be used to
fabricate microscale complex lattice structures, 3D microfluidics, and optical components with the mechanical properties and heat and chemical resistance of solid glass.'
